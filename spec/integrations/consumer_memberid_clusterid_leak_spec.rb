# frozen_string_literal: true

# This integration test verifies that Consumer#cluster_id (and #member_id) do not leak the
# librdkafka-allocated string on every call.
#
# `rd_kafka_clusterid` / `rd_kafka_memberid` each return a newly allocated C string that the
# caller must release with `rd_kafka_mem_free`. They were bound with a `:string` return type,
# which makes FFI copy the bytes into a Ruby String but never free the underlying buffer, so
# every call leaked it. (`rd_kafka_clusterid` was additionally bound with the wrong arity,
# missing its `timeout_ms` argument.) They are now bound as `:pointer`, copied into a Ruby
# string, and freed.
#
# We hammer cluster_id and assert RSS stays flat. RSS is read from /proc on Linux; on platforms
# without /proc the calls are still exercised (no crash) but growth is not asserted.
#
# Requires a running Kafka broker at localhost:9092.
#
# Exit codes:
# - 0: no significant memory growth (or growth not measurable on this platform)
# - 1: the cluster id could not be fetched, or RSS grew (leak still present)
